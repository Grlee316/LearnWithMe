Summary:
- Some degree of interference if you have two or more access points that uses the same channel when the range overlap
- typically choose channels 1, 6, 11 for 2.4 Ghz network
- on 5 GHz, there are 24 non-overlapping channels to choose from as long as you choose the lower bandwidth
- 

Keywords:
- co-channel interferance
-> creates a line where each device needs to wait its turn 
-> add latency

- adjecent channel congestion
-> happens when they use overlapping channels
-> non-overlapping channels are few, and you will ended up with the overlapping ones
-> dropped packets and pottentially dropped connections
