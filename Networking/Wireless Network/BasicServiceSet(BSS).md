summary:
- network topology that allows all wireless devices to communicate with each other through a common medium (AP)
- AP allows the wireless devices to get connected, and start communcating with each otehr
- AP will checks whether the client fit any of the following criteria or not:
-> Matching SSID
-> Compatible wireless data rate i.e. transmission speed
-> Auth cred

Advantages : 
-BSS is a small range network therefore it is more secure.  
-Devices or computers communicate easily with each other without any problem.  
-AP also manages all stations within this network and thereby making the network more portable and manageable. 

Disadvantages : 
- BSS only contains one AP therefore it does not support mobility i.e. clients cannot move freely from one place to another. 
- It only provides short-range wireless communication. 
-  As BSS includes only one AP and many devices or clients or stations, every station or client shares or communicates through the same medium. This can create some issues or problems while transmission. Therefore, it is recommended that BSS should include only a limited number of devices.
